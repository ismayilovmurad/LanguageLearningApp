// MARK: If you have a property in your view, and you use that property in the viewâ€™s body, when the property value changes, the view is unaffected. If you make the property a state property by applying the @State attribute, thanks to some magic that SwiftUI and the compiler do under the hood, the view reacts to property changes, refreshing the relevant portion of the view hierarchy that references that property.

// MARK: With @Binding, you create a property similar to a state property, but with the data stored and owned elsewhere: in a state property or an observable object of an ancestor view.
